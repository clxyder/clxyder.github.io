However, the lack of experience in proven MVDC technology has inherent risks of substantial delays during the development process of controllers. Model based system engineering methods, specifically controller hardware in the loop simulations, provide powerful means to lower the risk of a control development cycle. The ability to incrementally refine the fidelity of the model during the development and integration of a controller towards a more accurate representation of the power system is expected to reduce the frequency and severity of potential problems.\nIn the early stages of the control development, a control developer’s main concern is to verify that the algorithm implementation meets the functional requirements to satisfy the needs of the shipboard power system. Performance of the implementation at this stage is of less concern. There may also be limited knowledge about the specific power system that in the future will communicate with the controller. Hence, initially a reduced fidelity model can suffice. As the development process progresses, the model will evolve to ever increasing fidelity and accuracy. Eventually, the model will have to include all the relevant details and execute in real-time to test the controller’s real-time performance before field deployment.\nIn order to facilitate such progressive refinements in fidelity and real-time capability, an adaptable signal interface between high-level supervisory controller and models has been developed and tested. In particular, this thesis presents design criteria and requirements for such an interface focusing on the development of a fault management approach for a breakerless MVDC system. The signal interface considers different operational platforms, changing communication behaviors, signal descriptions, and simulator and controller endpoints, to connect different simulation environments to the controller making it adaptable.\nExperimental results validate the interface design and control development process. The process begins by evaluating the functional requirements of the fault management system in a low-fidelity discrete event simulation. Once, there is sufficient confidence that the algorithm can perform its core functionalities, by virtue of the proposed interface, the development process continues on a high-fidelity real-time simulation. At this point, the process proceeds to evaluate the functional and performance requirements with respect to time, arriving at a more rigorous evaluation of the control. The thesis concludes that the proposed approach is a feasible method to ease the control development process, by incrementally integrating models of higher fidelity. While acknowledging the additional work required to continually improve the process for a more generic use in the future.","tags":null,"title":"An adaptable signal interface to enable a fault management development process for a medium voltage DC microgrid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olugbenga Moses Anubi","Charalambos Konstantinou","Carlos A.

Due to the tight coupling of physics, communication and computation, a malicious agent can exploit multiple inherent vulnerabilities in order to inject stealthy signals into the measurement process. The problem setting considers the scenario in which an attacker strategically corrupts portions of the data in order to force wrong state estimates which could have catastrophic consequences. The goal of the proposed observer is to compute the true states in-spite of the adversarial corruption. In the formulation, we use a measurement prior distribution generated by the auxiliary model to refine the feasible region of a traditional compressive sensing-based regression problem. A constrained optimization-based observer is developed using l1-minimization scheme. Numerical experiments show that the solution of the resulting problem recovers the true states of the system. The developed algorithm is evaluated through a numerical simulation example of the IEEE 14-bus system.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-Model Resilient Observer under False Data Injection Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Neuwirt","Jean D.H.
