We specifically consider a breakerless medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) zonal shipboard power system architecture. The reconfiguration algorithm was implemented and tested in a controller hardware-in-the-loop setup with a notional 4-zone MVDC real-time model. Simulation results demonstrate the approach and its efficacy. We conclude, that this approach is a viable candidate for future MVDC system designs.","tags":null,"title":"A Tree-Based Reconfiguration Algorithm for Zonal Shipboard Power Systems","type":"publication"}]
